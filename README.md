# Decryption using Binary Search Tree

This was my 3rd Semester Project.

The project is based on decrypting the string into its original form. For this there will be lot of possible cases like adding, subtracting, even odd addition in the string by n times until the correct word is found in the text file. 

Note: Project also has limitations it will only work if the decryption form is present in backend file.
